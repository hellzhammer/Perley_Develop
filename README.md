# Perley Develop

This is an attempt to make a useable IDE. I am working on getting .net core running first and then maybe implementing another language. 

The IDE is going to use a plugin system for extensability.

I will be using 2 different compilers, one is already implemented and the other I am still working on, on the side. 

    --Compiler 1: Console based, runs console commands in background using dotnet CLI.
    --Compiler 2: C# compiler implementation. 

Both compilers will be available via plugins and can be turned on or off in the editor. (todo, not currently added)

The code is messy, but that will change. There are going to be several updates to this repo over time. 

# NOTE 
 -- There are libraries the project relies on that I will not be releasing source code for.
